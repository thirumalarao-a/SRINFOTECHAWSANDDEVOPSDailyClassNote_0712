DevOps::
DevOps is a software development and operations (DevOps) methodology that combines these two to improve efficiency and speed up project deliverables, It's very important because it helps businesses/deliver software faster and with higher quality.

What is the key purpose of DevOps? 

The primary goal of DevOps is to bridge the gap between development and operations teams. It creates a streamlined, efficient workflow that delivers software faster and with higher quality. DevOps is a set of practices,tools that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams.

DevOps Engineer Roles::
=========================

1)The devops engineer was responsibility to release the product to the market as soon as possible 

2) release the product speed to the market

3)Devops engineer was give continues feedback to the developers 

4) Devops engineer responsibility start from git and end with production

5) Design, build, and maintain Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

6) Automate the build, test, and deployment processes.


   
Benefits of DevOps ::
=======================

1) Faster software delivery

2)Reduces lead times and speeds up the software delivery process • 

3)Higher software quality

4)Addresses bugs quicker and improves software quality 

5)Better collaboration

6)Unifies development and operations teams, enhancing collaboration and efficiency 

7)Competitive advantage: Creates a more nimble software development lifecycle that gives businesses an advantage over their competitors

What is Git?

Git is a free, open-source version control system (VCS) that helps developers manage their code. It's the most widely used tool VCS(version control system) Git is fast for committing, branching, merging, and comparing past versions Git is very high Performance and Flexibility,Security.

Github::
==========

Github is a one of the SCM(Source code management) tool and store the Project code.

Repository: 
===================

storage area of your source code. Create a Repository on GitHub  

OR

Repositories::	
==============

Storage spaces for your project files and history. Think of it as a folder for a project.


Github Introduction::
==================

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to store and manage their code in repositories.

Version Control: :: GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code. This allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's contributions.

Repositories::: where you can store your project files and track the history of changes made to those files.Public and private repos can be created depending on accessibility needs.

Successfully Fork done from someone else's repository 

once above steps done ,please clone the Project and Modified files and push to github repository


Git Commands::
================

1. git clone <repository url>

>git clone 

>cd <repository name>

>git status

>git add --all

after added the files we need to verify the status of the files

>git status

>git commit -m "message"

>git push    ---> push the changes from local machine to remote

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "srinfotechbatch5@gmail.com"

Github branching strategy::
===========================

Github Branching Model::
-------------------------------

A GitHub branching model is a structured way of organizing branches in a Git repository to manage development workflows effectively. It helps teams work collaboratively, isolate features, manage releases, and deploy code more efficiently.



<img width="1729" height="775" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e6620b7-7339-423c-855d-537c8fb3d6d2" />


A GitHub branching strategy is crucial for maintaining an organized workflow in version control. There are different strategies depending on the size of the project, the number of team members, and the desired workflow. Here are some common branching strategies used in GitHub:

main or master branch:: This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically.
main or master branch always stable and live code 

feature branch:: It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

formate:: feature/YYYY.MM.DD
 feature/2025.08.05

release branch:: Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle.
always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

release/2025.08.10




Create New Branch::
=================

Click Branches


<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a795a257-a126-449e-9dba-22729bec940d" />

Branches:
==============


main (or master): Always production-ready.

feature/*: Used for new features.

release/*: Prepares for a new production release.

main or master branch:: 
=====================

This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically. main or master branch always stable and live code

feature branch:: 
===============

It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

formate:: 
=============

feature/YYYY.MM.DD feature/2025.06.22

release branch:: 
====================

Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle. always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

release/2025.07.20



Raise PR (Pull Request) :: 
=================================

Merge the code from one branch to another branch that is called pull request

below are the steps to raise PR::

Go to -->Pull requests and click

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baf5a7d7-f69d-44e8-87ad-ae67d082353f" />

please select base & compare branches so here base branch is release/2025.08.10 and compare branch is feature/2025.08.05

i'm going to merge code changes from feature branch to release branch

Execute the Jobs in Parallel::
==============================


1.By Default execute the Jenkins build jobs are sequence way,one by one 

2.Don’t do 2 projects build parallel  this is real time scenario but we can do parallel builds as well one job

Jenkins build parallel setup

Go job ---> configure ----> Generall ---> Execute concurrent builds if necessary

Please create a New Jenkins jobs both POLL SCM & Build Periodically 

https://github.com/srinfotechbatch5/spring-petclinic.git

Automatically Discard Old Builds:::
==============================
To automate the process of discarding old builds, you can configure the job’s settings to automatically delete old builds based on criteria such as the number of builds to keep or the age of the builds.

Follow these steps:

Open the Jenkins job (project).
Click on Configure (on the left-hand side).
Scroll down to the Build Discarder section (usually under the Build Triggers section).
Check Discard old builds.
Specify the following options:
Max # of builds to keep: Set the maximum number of builds to keep.
Max days to keep builds: Set the maximum age for builds to keep.
Save the configuration by clicking Save.

3.For every company will do sequence build on one project this is recommended approach



General  ---just descriptin

SCM

where is your project--github, bitbucket

Triggere

whenever code changes i want build the project given time

Environmant

--all about workspaces folders

Build Steps

dev team will tell which tool we are using in current project


Post Build

devops engineer is aim is given continue feedback to dev team via email notification
